# Which item class code should I use?

An `item_class_code` is required when creating an item. eTIMS uses a subset of the open, global, multi-sector standard for efficient, accurate classification of products and services - United Nations Standard Products and Services Code® (UNSPSC®).

### UNSPSC Reference

- [www.ungm.org/public/unspsc](https://www.ungm.org/public/unspsc) (UNGM resource)

* ​[usa.databasesets.com/unspsc](https://usa.databasesets.com/unspsc) (USA resource)

You can download the entire list [here](https://www.ungm.org/public/unspsc) (UNGM resource). To determine which item class code to use, follow the steps below.

  All item types are classified with item class codes

  There are three item types (Raw material, Finished Product and Service). All items under these types are classified with item class codes.

## Default item class code values

The <Anchor target="_blank" href="doc:items-item-classification-table">Item Classification Table</Anchor> contains hundreds of classification codes (yet it's not full exhaustive). To get as specific as possible to the classification code, refer to the steps in [this specific item class code values list](https://ke.docs.digitax.tech/docs/which-item-class-code-should-i-use#specific-item-class-code-values).

Otherwise, below are some common item class code values that you can use while testing or for convenience.

| Item class code | Item class name                                                      | Item Classification Level |

## Specific item class code values

### Process

1. Search for the item name at either the <Anchor target="_blank" href="https://www.ungm.org/public/unspsc">UN UNSPSC reference</Anchor> or the <Anchor target="_blank" href="https://usa.databasesets.com/unspsc">USA UNSPSC reference</Anchor>. If no result is returned, use synonyms or segments of the name (especially if it is a compound word like _eyeglass_)
2. Copy the first four numbers of the item's code from the item you've determined as exactly matching your item, or closest to it by definition.
3. Search for those copied first four numbers at the guide page - [Items: Item Classification Table](doc:items-item-classification-table)\\<br />(If there is more than one entry, pick the closest by definition).

### Example

**Eyeglass frames** are not available on the [Items: Item Classification Table](doc:items-item-classification-table) therefore:

1. Via the <Anchor target="_blank" href="https://www.ungm.org/public/unspsc">UN UNSPSC reference</Anchor>
   - (_step #1 above_) I searched for "eyeglass frames" and got nothing. I then search for "eyeglass" and got a few options.
   - (_step #2 above_) I copy the first four numbers of the code, "4214"
2. Via the USA resource&#x20;

- (_step #1 above_) I searched for "eyeglass frames" and got "42142903".
- (_step #2 above_) I copy the first four numbers of the code, "4214"

_(step #3 above_) In the [Items: Item Classification Table](doc:items-item-classification-table), there are two entries starting with "4214".

- "42140000" (Patient care and treatment products and supplies)
- "42141600" (Basins and bedpans and urinals and admission kits)

I'll use "42140000" which is more general, instead of "42141600".

Moreover, **eyeglass frames** are closer in definition to "Patient care and treatment products and supplies" than "Patient care and treatment products and supplies", right?
