Callback URLs are there to inform you about important events happening on our system.

An optional additional `callback_url` property is accepted for both [Add business item](ref:post_items) (**POST**) and [Add sale](ref:post_sales) (**POST**) endpoints.

## Scenarios

We send the following callbacks:

1. When an item has been synced to eTIMS, we send a POST request to the provided `callback_url`. The request body contains a `data` object with details about the synced item, and an `event` property with the value `item.sync`.
2. When a sale/ credit note has been synced to eTIMS, we also send a POST request to the `callback_url`. The request body contains a `data` object with details about the synced sale, and an `event` property with the value `sale.sync`.
