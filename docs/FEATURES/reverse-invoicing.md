## Overview

Typically, invoicing is the obligation of the supplier to get paid for the service rendered or goods sold.

### Usual invoice creation

An invoice generation flow has two parties - a buyer and a supplier (of a good or service), with the supplier typically issuing an invoice and the buyer later on paying for the good or service bought.

### Reverse invoice creation

With an aim to streamline the generation of invoices, reverse invoicing allows the buyer (instead of the supplier) to initiate the generation of an invoice.

## Reverse Invoicing In-depth

Reverse Invoicing is a consent-driven innovation, meaning the supplier will have to pre-authorize either per invoice or one-time (in the cases of recurrent invoices)

The prerequisites are:

* The supplier is registered with the tax regulator to generate invoices
* The supplier permits the buyer to generate invoices on their behalf, either one-time (IMPLICIT) or per invoice (EXPLICIT)

### Reverse Invoicing Process (General)

This is how it works:

1. A supplier record is added by the buyer, providing the PIN, Name, and Phone number
2. KRA sends a token to the added supplier to be used as verification that permission has been granted for reverse invoicing (Details to follow) marking the supplier status as COMPLETED
3. The typical invoice flow is now followed, only that supplier details are included, and the outcome would be as though the supplier generated the invoice, yet it was initiated by the buyer
